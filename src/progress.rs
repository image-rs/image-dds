/// A progress reporter used by [`Encoder`](crate::Encoder) and
/// [`encode()`](crate::encode()).
///
/// This structure is just a wrapper around a function that handles progress
/// reports. A progress report is a single `f32` value between 0 to 1
/// representing the percentage of the task that has been completed.
///
/// Encoders will generally try to make 10 to 50 progress reports per second.
/// This is a best effort basis, so reports may be more or less frequent. In
/// certain scenarios, there may be dozens of reports within 1 millisecond.
///
/// Reports are guaranteed to only increase or stay the same. I.e. after 40%
/// has been reported, the next report may be 40% again, 42%, or similar, but
/// never 39% or lower. In particular, there may be multiple reports for 100%.
///
/// ## Multi-threaded progress reporting
///
/// Encoding may happen in parallel across multiple threads. As such, progress
/// reports may come from multiple threads at the same time.
///
/// The main constructor [`Progress::new()`] takes a report function that can
/// be called from multiple threads. This is the **recommended** constructor.
///
/// If you cannot provide a thread-safe function, use
/// [`Progress::new_single_threaded()`]. The main downside of this is that
/// progress reports will be less frequent. In particular, formats that encoded
/// in parallel (e.g. BC1) will suddenly jump from 0% to 100% without any
/// progress in between.
///
/// Note that single-threaded progress reporters will **not** prevent or
/// interfere with parallel encoding in any way. There's no performance
/// penalty.
///
/// ## Cancellation
///
/// A progress reporter may optionally be initialized with a
/// [`CancellationToken`] using [`with_cancellation()`](Progress::with_cancellation).
/// This allows operations that receive a [`Progress`] to be cancelled
/// cooperatively and concurrently.
